## Playnite Apex Launch Options For AutoHotkey

APEX has introduced a new feature that prevents games from starting if a running programs that give players an unfair competitive advantage.

> On Wednesday, we rolled out an update to our [@PlayApex](https://x.com/PlayApex) anti-cheat that blocks programs that give players an unfair competitive advantage.
>
> If you are unable to launch the game, please disable any programs running in the background that may interfere with Apex.

This meant that games could not be started using AutoHotkey.

As a workaround, I created a launch option to disable AutoHotkey when APEX starts and enable it when exiting. Below are the guide and code.

---

- Open Edit, then Scripts.

### Execute before starting a game

```powershell
# Check if an AutoHotkey process is running, and terminate it if found
if (Get-Process -Name "AutoHotkey" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
  Stop-Process -Name "AutoHotkey" -Force
}
```

- End the AutoHotkey process if it is running

### Execute after exiting a game

```powershell
# Define the path to the AutoHotkey executable
$ahkExePath = "C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe"

# Define the path to your AutoHotkey script
$ahkScriptPath = "{USERDIR}\{FILENAME}.ahk"

# Check if the AutoHotkey process is already running
if (-not (Get-Process -Name "AutoHotkey" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
  # Verify that both the AutoHotkey executable and the script exist
  if ((Test-Path $ahkExePath) -and (Test-Path $ahkScriptPath)) {
    # Start the AutoHotkey script if paths are valid and not already running
    Start-Process $ahkExePath -ArgumentList $ahkScriptPath
  }
}
```

- `$ahkExePath` is the path to the AutoHotkey executable.  
  If you have not changed the installation location, there is no need to change it since it is located by default.

- **`$ahkScriptPath` should specify the path of the `.ahk` file you are executing.**
